# broadlink-java-api

This project is still in very early development stage!

Thanks for https://github.com/mjg59/python-broadlink ! I really appreciate for his/her time in reverse engineering the protocol!

I would like to integrate in my own home system (private, [SakuraHome](https://github.com/mob41/Sakura)) so I suggested to start the work of the API in Java.
